# BackPropagation
Backpropagation implementation to draw a curve randomly generated. The project goal is to develop all the required steps without using backpropagation functions from existing libraries

All the relevant functions are defined in the module file (backprog_module.ipynb) while the Main_file is used to define the target curve, plottin intial status and the results.

Also, a MSE function is defined since the next step would be measuring accuracy for different settings of neural networl
